# Inventory Management System

We require the development of an Inventory Management System (IMS) that addresses the need for efficient tracking and reporting of raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished products within our organization. This IMS should have the capacity to generate spreadsheet reports on a weekly and monthly basis. Moreover, it must be platform-independent, ensuring compatibility with various operating systems.

The current manual inventory management process has proven to be error-prone, time-consuming, and lacks real-time visibility into stock levels and movement of materials and products. This deficiency has led to operational inefficiencies, stockouts, overstock situations, and increased costs.


## Key Points
- Centralized Tracking: Create a robust system for tracking raw materials, semi-finished goods, and finished products in real-time, enabling easy access to inventory data for various departments within the organization.
- Reporting Capabilities: Develop the system's capacity to generate detailed, accurate, and user-friendly spreadsheet reports on a weekly and monthly basis, facilitating data-driven decision-making and inventory optimization.
- Platform Independence: Ensure that the Inventory Management System can run seamlessly on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing flexibility and accessibility to all relevant users.
- User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that simplifies data input, retrieval, and modification, reducing the learning curve for users across different departments.
- Automation and Alerts: Implement automated features such as low stock alerts, reorder point notifications, and tracking historical data trends to assist in making informed procurement and production decisions.
- Security and Data Integrity: Maintain a high level of data security to protect sensitive inventory information while ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized access.
- Scalability: Design the system to accommodate the organization's current inventory needs while allowing for future growth and expansion.
- Training and Support: Develop training materials and provide necessary support to ensure a smooth transition to the new Inventory Management System and ongoing user assistance.
